# keylogger
A program to detect what keys are pressed on a computer, takes a screenshot of one's screen, copies the clipboard data, and user's system information. All of this information would then be sent to the specified email declared in keylog.py. The information taken would also be encrypted and sent to the specified email as well and can be decrypted using the DecryptFile.py file. Additionally, one can edit the Key used for the encrypted files by running KeyGenerator.py.

To run the program one can either download all of the files and run main.py in the terminal. Or one can download the application and run the main.exe file.
